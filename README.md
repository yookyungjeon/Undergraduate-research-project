# Graphical Lasso‚Äìguided MICE ‚Äî Simulation Study on High-Dimensional Missing Data Imputation


## 1. Research Overview

This repository presents a simulation study of the  
**Graphical Lasso‚Äìguided Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (Glasso-MICE)** algorithm,  
designed to improve missing data imputation in **high-dimensional settings**.  

The core idea is to estimate the **conditional dependency structure (precision matrix)**  
using **Graphical Lasso** and incorporate this structure into the  
**MICE predictor matrix** to enhance imputation accuracy.  
Rather than imputing values independently, this approach enables  
**structure-guided imputation** that reflects the underlying network relationships among variables.

## 2. Research Objectives

- Improve imputation accuracy under **high-dimensional conditions**  
- Integrate **Graphical Lasso‚Äìestimated dependency structures** into the MICE process  
- Compare the effects of different **initial imputations** (mean vs. MICE)  
  and **structural constraints** (excluding diagonal entries in voting)  
- Evaluate performance against **Default MICE**, **Lasso-based MICE**, and **Oracle (complete data)** settings

## 3. Simulation Overview

Each simulation examines how accurately different imputation strategies  
recover the true dependency structure (precision matrix)  
when **10% MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)** values are introduced.  

| Method | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Proposed (Glasso-guided MICE)** | Iterative MICE guided by precision matrices estimated via Graphical Lasso |
| **Completed Data (Oracle)** | Benchmark estimation from complete data without missingness |
| **MICE (Default)** | Standard MICE assuming variable independence |
| **MICE (Lasso)** | MICE using lasso-based conditional models (`lasso.select.norm`) |

Each method is repeated across 10 random seeds,  
and evaluated using **FPR (False Positive Rate)**, **TPR (True Positive Rate)**,  
and **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)**.

## 7. Summary of Results

- **Proposed (Glasso-guided MICE)**  
  Incorporating network structures from Graphical Lasso  
  led to higher AUC values and improved structural recovery compared to standard MICE.  

- **MICE (Default / Lasso)**  
  Provided stable imputations but underperformed in network reconstruction accuracy.  

- **Completed Data (Oracle)**  
  Serves as the upper performance bound for model comparison.  

All results are summarized as averaged ROC curves (across 10 runs),  
AUC comparison tables, and timing summaries for each simulation step.
